This Weather App is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to fetch real-time weather information for any city. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app provides a clean user interface where users can input a city name and retrieve weather data such as temperature, weather condition, and more. It interacts with a third-party weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch up-to-date data dynamically using JavaScript. This project is ideal for beginners learning API integration and DOM manipulation, while also serving as a practical utility for daily weather checks.
